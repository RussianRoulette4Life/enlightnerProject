# Enlightner Project (this is doomed to fail)

So i've been learning `svelte` lately, and this project is a simple UI that i am working on that will be the frontend of my new website - `Enlightner`. The name came from the purpose of the future website to be a specialised kind of social media, on which people of numerous specialties could find themselves a corner to *learn* and *chat*. The model is simple - people have 2 ways to content - *MESSAGES* and *ARTICLES*, both of which could be in a single *POST*. I will integrate image and video upload support, as well as *maybe a youtube/reddit integration*. And, of course, the most important thing - *`an API for bots`*. I am acitvely working on the project, and if you stumble upon it... well, i'm preppared for everything :)

# How to spin up the website

So this is quite simple:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RussianRoulette4Life/enlightnerProject
```
```bash
  cd enlightnerProject
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```
3. Spin up the website:
```bash
  npm run dev
```

  OR
  
```bash
  nodemon express.js
```


And then search in the browser for `localhost:3000`
